/*
* Commentary:
* The crux is definitely realizing you can take a greedy approach and do this in one pass if you
* sort the meetings first. From there the actual merging gets kind of trivial.
*
* I quite like this problem as an entry-level or just-beyond-entry-level coding interview problem
* because I think it gives a lot of signal as to who *actually* has facility with coding and/or a
* programming language, if that kind of signal is important to you as an interviewer. If you've put
* in some real coding time you will likely know how to call a sort on your array as well as take
* the max of two numbers in your language of choice like the back of your hand without having to
* ask your interviewer. I also know that at my (full-stack webdev) job I was *constantly* having to
* sort and reduce arrays of user data etc. so the solution to this problem came very instinctively
* and you might expect someone of similar background not to struggle with this problem.
*
* A note about array.slice and array.reduce: Yes, I know that using a manual for-loop starting at
* index 1 and array.push'ing meetings would save about n cycles vs. having to copy the array with
* slice. But when I do coding problems I like to imagine that I was actually implementing a feature
* at my real job â€“ and at my real job, declarative programming is massively more maintainable,
* debuggable, and refactorable than imperative programming (why this is is a topic for another day).
* Javascript can process a list like this with 100000 entries in miliseconds anyway, and so as long
* as you don't change big-O efficiency, in a webapp the performance bottleneck will always
* overwhelmingly come from network request latency, not your extra array pass-through. Trading a
* negligible (and I mean negligible) performance hit in exchange for code
* clarity/safety/maintainability etc. is worth it many times over, and pointing out and explaining
* this decision could be an opportunity to show your knowledge and aptitude for the role (even if
* your interviewer might not have made the same decision! But of course context is key; if you're
* going to be implementing credit card payment processing or working some other area where
* incremental performance gains are important, maybe stick with the manual for-loop!).
